## Overview

This project enables users to classify images of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi, protozoa) and train custom machine learning models using Google’s Teachable Machine platform. Teachable Machine simplifies the process of creating models by providing an intuitive, browser-based interface.

## Features

- Train custom image classification models using Teachable Machine.
- Classify microorganism images with pretrained models.
- Export and integrate trained models into applications or scripts.
- Beginner-friendly setup with minimal coding required.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes images of microorganisms categorized as:
- Bacteria
- Fungi
- Protozoa
- Viruses

You can source or create your dataset by collecting labeled images of microorganisms. For convenience, example datasets can be found [here](#).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/microorganism-image-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd microorganism-image-classification
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (if running scripts locally):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Using Teachable Machine

### Step 1: Prepare the Dataset

1. Collect and organize images into folders, with one folder per category (e.g., `Bacteria`, `Fungi`).
2. Ensure all images are resized appropriately and are of good quality.

### Step 2: Train the Model

1. Visit [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
2. Select the **Image Project** option and start a new project.
3. Upload your images by dragging and dropping them into the respective categories.
4. Train your model by clicking the "Train Model" button.

### Step 3: Export the Model

1. Once training is complete, export the model.
2. Choose the appropriate export format (e.g., TensorFlow, TensorFlow.js) for your deployment.
3. Download the model files to your local machine.

## Model Deployment

### Using TensorFlow.js

To deploy the model in a web application:
1. Copy the exported model files to your project folder.
2. Use the `model.json` file in your JavaScript code to load the model.
3. Follow the Teachable Machine’s [deployment guide](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/machine-learning/deploy/) for detailed instructions.

### Using Python

To use the model in Python scripts:
1. Export the model in TensorFlow format.
2. Load the model using TensorFlow or Keras:
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
   model = load_model('path_to_your_model')
   ```
3. Use the model for predictions on new images.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using validation data to measure performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall can be calculated using tools like Python’s scikit-learn library.

## Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset, making it suitable for applications in research and education. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are included in the `results` folder.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more microorganism categories.
- Improve model accuracy through data augmentation.
- Develop a user-friendly web application for image classification.
